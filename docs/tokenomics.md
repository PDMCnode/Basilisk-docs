Notes:
* The distribution of all tokens will **begin after the BSX LBP event has concluded**. The BSX LBP event will take place approximately 2-4 weeks after Basilisk has secured its first parachain slot.
* The exact start date of the rewards for collators and liquidity miners is currently unknown. This should take place within several weeks after conclusion of the BSX LBP event.
