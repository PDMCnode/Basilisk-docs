## What is Basilisk? {#what-is-basilisk}

Basilisk is a **liquidity protocol built for the Kusama ecosystem**. Its mission is to **enable frictionless liquidity** that caters to the evolving needs of crypto assets - **both fungible, and non-fungible (NFTs)**.

The **modular design** of Basilisk enables fungible assets to bootstrap liquidity by choosing the Automated Market Maker (AMM) model which they find the most convenient. The first version comes with an implementation of **Swap (XYK) pools** which allows users to **buy and sell tokens**, or to **become a liquidity provider and earn rewards generated from trades**.

For the **non-fungibles**, the first version ships with an **NFT Marketplace** with some spicy features. Besides **minting and listing NFTs**, the Basilisk Marketplace also brings the ability to **set a royalty fee** (a percentage of every trade goes to the owner of the fee), and to **place an offer for non-listed NFTs**. The Basilisk NFT Marketplace is made available with the kind support of our frens at KodaDot who have integrated our pallet into their UI.

In the following version, Basilisk is preparing to release an array of new features. **Liquidity Mining (LM)** will allow the Basilisk Protocol to incentivize liquidity provisioning to selected pools with BSX tokens from the Basilisk Treasury. Furthermore, **Liquidity Bootstrapping Pools (LBP)** will allow young crypto assets to bootstrap liquidity in a fair and economically efficient manner. And for the NFTs, we have been developing a mechanism which will allow you to **flip your NFTs using auctions** - English, Top up and Candle auctions.
