## What is Basilisk? {#what-is-basilisk}

Basilisk is a liquidity bootstrapping protocol built for Kusama. Its mission is to enable frictionless liquidity for the long tail crypto assets.

The modular design of Basilisk enables new crypto assets to bootstrap liquidity by choosing the Automated Market Maker (AMM) model which they find most convenient. The first version comes with implementations of a Liquidity Bootstrapping Pool (LBP) as well as XYK pools with order matching transactions. The following iterations will bring more advanced price discovery mechanisms to Basilisk such as auctions and bonding curves. An NFT marketplace is also on its way!

Basilisk has close ties with [HydraDX](https://hydradx.io) which has set out to become the go-to liquidity provider on the Polkadot network. Together, Basilisk and HydraDX create a synergy which caters to the varying liquidity needs of cryptoassets throughout their entire lifecycle. Bootstrap liquidity in the early stages using a Basilisk AMM, then move on to the HydraDX Omnipool to unlock unprecedented cross-chain liquidity in an ocean of assets.
